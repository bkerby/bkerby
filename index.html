      I am a Junior Application Developer with experience and interest in creating elegant frontends,
      utilizing modern technology. Over the course of one year I have assisted in updating 4
      intranet applications, both frontend and backend with technology such as, Angular 6+,
      Spring Boot, and Web Components. I was born and raised in Omaha Nebraska and went to the
      University of Nebraska at Omaha, where I persued my bachelor degree in Computer Science, with
      a minor in MIS and IT Innovation. When I am not working or in school I enjoy sailing, fishing, hunting, hanging out 
      with friends, and napping with my cat Hubert.

    <h3>Tavern</h3>
    <p>
      Tavern was an app that I created for my class Introduction to Software Engineering. Tavern 
      allows the users to start tabs immediately at whichever bar,
      theyâ€™re currently at or going to. When ordering drinks, a bartender will
      then be able to add drinks to the tab. The user can track their tab on the app.
      Most importantly, the user can pay off the tab and leave
      a tip through the application. There is no need for either the user
      or the bartender to seek each other out for tab closure. The app was created using Ionic 4, Angular 6+,
      Paypal API, and Google firebase (hosting, authentication and firestore backend).

    <h3>Wayside Monitor</h3>
    <p>
      Wayside Monitor was what I worked on primarily at Union Pacific. What the Wayside Monitor does is it takes data from
      the detector/inspectors that are placed on Union Pacific tracks. If a detector throws out an alert that a wheel or bearing
      is malfunctioning that alert is shown on the Wayside Monitor Application. This application is used by a desk that reviews
      the information for that current alert and that wheel or bearings history. Using this information if the person managing the 
      desk sees a trend or problem they can then alert the dispatcher to stop and/or inspect the train with the issue. What I did for this
      project was develop the frontend with one other intern, create REST services to get and update the large amount of data that Wayside Monitor
      processes, create report pages for the customer to gather more information on an alert. Some more managerial task I did for Wayside were:
      migrate the project from Angular 6 to Angular 8, help with the migration from SVN to Gitlab, and move the Spring Boot backend REST Services
      from a Java Standalone Environment to a Tomcat environment to meet Union Pacific Standards of production applications. The technology that
      I used while collaborating on this application were: Angular 6+, Spring Boot, MyBatis, CanvasHTML, Web Components (UP Library), and Gitlab.

      The chart below shows the skills and technology that I am familiar and have experience with. The skill level of each skill is based
      on how comfortable and experienced I am with that certian skill. Five means I have a advanced understanding of the technology, while one means
      I have a basic understanding of the technology.
