    <h1 >Wayside Monitor Demo</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Wayside Monitor was what I worked on primarily at Union Pacific. What the Wayside Monitor does is it takes data from
        the detector/inspectors that are placed on Union Pacific tracks. If a detector throws out an alert that a wheel or bearing
        is malfunctioning that alert is shown on the Wayside Monitor Application. This application is used by a desk that reviews
        the information for that current alert and that wheel or bearings history. Using this information if the person managing the 
        desk sees a trend or problem they can then alert the dispatcher to stop and/or inspect the train with the issue. What I did for this
        project was develop the frontend with one other intern, create REST services to get and update the large amount of data that Wayside Monitor
        processes, create report pages for the customer to gather more information on an alert. Some more managerial task I did for Wayside were:
        migrate the project from Angular 6 to Angular 8, help with the migration from SVN to Gitlab, and move the Spring Boot backend REST Services
        from a Java Standalone Environment to a Tomcat environment to meet Union Pacific Standards of production applications. The technology that
        I used while collaborating on this application were: Angular 6+, Spring Boot, MyBatis, CanvasHTML, Web Components (UP Library), and Gitlab.
