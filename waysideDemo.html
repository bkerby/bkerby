          In this first video you can see the main dashboard page. Here users can click on each alert in the table. From
          that alert
          they can view the history of that wheel bearing in the history chart down below which shows each passing of that
          bearing. They can also view
          where that wheel bearing is on the full train view to the right. In the train view they can compare the alerted
          bearing to the surronded bearings
          and in the history chart they can see if the alert is a trend or just a one of that doesn't need an action. After
          deciding one what action needs to be
          performed for that specific alert the user can select an action to perform in the drop down table or use a
          hotkey in order to perform that action. Then the user can move to the next pending alert (Red highlighted row) and so on.
          The chart below uses chartJS and CanvasHTML and the full train view to the right uses canvasHTML.

          This second video shows one of the report pages where users can come to get more information on a specific
          bearing or alert in order to decide
          if the alert needs to be escalated. This page specifically shows detector information from opened and closed alerts.
          There are many report pages such as this one for different information about the alerted train, bearing, or wheel.
          However, this page specifically was created and
          developed by me.

          This last demo video shows of the search page. This page allows for users to view passings that aren't
          necessarily on the main dashboard page.
          If the passing didn't throw an alert or the passing of the train is older than two weeks it can be viewed on
          this search page. The user can view
          passings on a specific train, passings from a specific detector, or passings that threw alerts to the main
          dashboard. On this page they can enter
          more search criteria then allowed on the main dashboard. This can help users filter down to a specific problem
          whether it be a problem with a
          detector, train, or certain passing. This page was created by me. I reused the full train view and history chart components.
          But I developed the search page tabs, tables, and filters.
